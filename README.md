Hey guys,
This is my first ever pyhton project. Here I'm using openCV and Numpy libraries of Python.

## Description

The screen is logically divided into 4 parts. When a particular color (in my case Blue) is detected in those parts a key press is called. Suppose Blue color was detected on the top left part of screen then a "A" key press is initiated and the car will turn left.
The color boundaries were set using color.py in which we set range of HSV values for Blue color. Key press and key release fucntion was used from directkeys.py file.
